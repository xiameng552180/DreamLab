abstract: Lighting education is a foundational component of cinematography education. However, many art schools do not have expensive soundstages for traditional cinematography lessons. Migrating physical setups to virtual experiences is a potential solution driven by metaverse initiatives. Yet there is still a lack of knowledge on the design of a VR system for teaching cinematography. We first analyzed the educational needs for cinematography lighting education by conducting interviews with six cinematography professionals from academia and industry. Accordingly, we presented Art Mirror, a VR soundstage for teachers and students to emulate cinematography lighting in virtual scenarios. We evaluated Art Mirror from the aspects of usability, realism, presence, sense of agency, and collaboration. Sixteen participants were invited to take a cinematography lighting course and assess the design elements of Art Mirror. Our results demonstrate that Art Mirror is usable and useful for cinematography lighting education, which sheds light on the design of VR cinematography education.
